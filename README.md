you know what's cool?  *not doing any work*.

This library downloads data from wikipedia and generates helpful datasets, all on its own.

It's not working well yet.


### 1) set ./config.js
by default it runs on the english wikipedia:
```js
module.exports = {
  lang: 'af',
  project: 'wikipedia'
}
```

### 2) start it
`npm run start`

that's all.
